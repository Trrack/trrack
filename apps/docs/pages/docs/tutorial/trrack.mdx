# Trrack

## State

After creating the `registry` and registering our actions we can initialize Trrack instance.

Apart from the `registry`, we need the `application state` to initilize Trrack.

```typescript copy
type State {
    // ... model your application state here. Flat structure is better for modular updates as well as storing diffs.
}

const state: State = {
    // ... initialize your application state here with default values
}
```

## Trrack Instance

Now with the `registry` and `state` we can initialize Trrack.

```typescript copy
import { initializeTrrack } from '@trrack/core';

const trrack = initializeTrrack({
  initialState: state,
  registry, // registry created in the previous section
});
```

## Listener

Trrack provides a listener to subscribe to state change. State change happens when moving between nodes in the provenance graph either due to creation of a new node, an undo or a redo.

```typescript copy
trrack.currentChange(() => {
  // Response to state change here
});
```

You can register multiple listeners and Trrack will call them all in order.

## Accessing current state

Trrack stores the state as either as entire snapshot or a diff from the previous state.
You can access the current state using the `getState` method as follows.

```typescript copy
const state = trrack.getState();
```

## Traversal

You can jump to any node in the provenance graph using the `to` method.

```typescript copy
trrack.to(// node id);
```

Trrack also provides helper methods to `undo` and `redo` in the provenance graph using methods of the same name.
