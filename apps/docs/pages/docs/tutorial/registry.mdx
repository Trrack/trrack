# Action Registry

The first step in adding `Trrack` to your application is to create a action registry using the `Registry` class.

```javascript
const registry = Registry.create();
```

Now actions can be registered in the registry. Actions are the only way `Trrack` knows that something has happened and it has to update the provenance graph.

## Action Types

There are two types of actions that can be registered.

### State Action

State actions get the current `state` of the application as an argument and can modify it based on the `payload`, which is the second argument.
This is similar to [redux reducers](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-2-concepts-data-flow#reducers).

```typescript
// Action which updates the `count` key in the state by desired value.
const incrementAction = registry.register(
  'increment-action', // Action name
  // Action handler which receives the current state and a payload.
  (currentState: State, payload: number) => {
    currentState.count += payload;
  }
);
```

When state actions are executed, the changes to the state are stored in a new provenance node.

### Trrack Action

The other type of action that is supported is called a `Trrack action`. These actions do not modify the application state, but execute any arbitrary side effect.

When `trrack action` is executed, `Trrack` keeps a record of execution and the payload of the action.
You need to provide a `undo` counterpart to each action to allow `Trrack` to undo the action.

An `trrack action` can be set as undo for itself.

```typescript
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];

registry.register('sort', (sortBy: 'asc' | 'dsc') => {
  if (sortBy === 'asc') arr.sort();
  if (sortBy === 'dsc') arr.sort().reverse();

  return {
    type: 'sort',
    payload: sortBy === 'asc' ? 'dsc' : 'asc',
    meta: {
      hasSideEffects: true,
    },
  };
});
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Trrack provides no guarantees if the `trrack action` is properly undone by the
  `undo action`. We rely on developers for correct implementation. Trrack can
  only guarantee that the undo action will be called properly during the
  traversal.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  You should be using `state actions` exclusively in your application. State
  actions allow for faster traversal through the provenance graph.
</Callout>
