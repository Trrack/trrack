# Current Change Event

### Basic usage

By default Trrack keeps a pointer the latest added node. This can be accessed using `trrack.current`. Using `undo`, `redo`, and `todo` will update this pointer to the appropriate node. Trrack emits a `currentChange` event whenever current node changes due to any reason.

To respond to the `currentChange` event you can register a listener. The `currentChange` listener gets an optional argument which is the `trigger` for the current change.

```ts
import { initializeTrrack } from '@trrack/core';

const trrack = initializeTrrack({ ... });

trrack.currentChange(() => {
  // Do something...
});
```

### Cleaning up

`currentChange` function returns an unsubscribe function which can be used to remove the listener to avoid memory leaks.

```ts
import { initializeTrrack } from '@trrack/core';

const trrack = initializeTrrack({ ... });

const unsubscribe = trrack.currentChange(() => {
  // Do something...
});

// Call unsubscribe to remove the listener
unsubscribe();
```

### Advanced usage with state management libraries

Current change event is the primary way to interact with the store from a state management library like `redux` or `pinia`.

`currentChange` event is used to sync the state of the store with current state from Trrack.
A general workflow for such integration looks like following:

- Initialize store
- Initialize trrack with initialState (possibly from store)
- Setup store update actions to also inform Trrack about the udpates
- Register `currentChange` listener to update the store state with the current state from Trrack in case of `traversal`.

Let's assume we have a provenance graph which looks as follows:

```ts
|
A (State 1)
|
B (State 2)
|
C (State 3) <-- Current
|
```

The state of the store is the same as `State 3`.

If we execute `trrack.undo()` at this point, the graph will be updated:

```ts
|
A (State 1)
|
B (State 2) <-- Current
|
C (State 3)
|
```

However, our store state is still `State 3`. Inside the `currentChange` listener we can update the store state with the current state from Trrack.

```ts
trrack.currentChange(() => {
  const newState = trrack.getState(); // gets the state from current node

  store.update(newState); // update the store state
});
```

This works great when we are traversing the graph. However, if we execute `trrack.apply()` when `current` is pointing to `State 3` the store updates to `State 4`. Our state update actions also inform trrack about the new state, and the graph will be updated:

```ts
|
A (State 1)
|
B (State 2)
|
C (State 3)
|
D (State 4) <-- Current
|
```

Since a new node was added to Trrack and current pointer changed to point to it, the `currentChange` event is triggered, which updates the store, and may cause re-rendering.

Trrack passes `trigger` argument to the `currentChange` listener. If `trigger` is `new` we can skip the store update. The value for `trigger` can be `traversal` or `new`. `traversal` means that the current node was changed due to a `undo`, `redo`, or `to` command. `new` means that the current node was changed due to a `apply` command. This way we can avoid updating the store state when the current node is changed due to addition of new node.

```ts
trrack.currentChange((trigger: Trigger) => {
  if (trigger === 'new') return; // skip store update

  const newState = trrack.getState(); // gets the state from current node
  store.update(newState); // update the store state
});
```

Such a use case can be found very frequently when two state containers update each other. To handle such case, the `currentChange` function accepts a second optional boolean argument which is `skipOnNew`.
Passing `true` to `skipOnNew` will skip the store update when the current node is changed due to addition of new node.

```ts
trrack.currentChange((trigger: Trigger) => {
  /** do not need this anymore */
  // if (trigger === 'new') return;

  const newState = trrack.getState(); // gets the state from current node
  store.update(newState); // update the store state
}, true); // skip store update when current node is changed due to addition of new node
```
